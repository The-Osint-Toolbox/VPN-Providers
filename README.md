    </p>VPNs over the years have gone from being a niche tool for specfic people or uses to a mass market product. Some argue that this has diluted the effectiveness of a VPN. Some things to consider when using a VPN. Do they have a no logging policy, as this policy been audited. Location of the compnay and sever locations. DNS Leak protection. Kill switch. These are what I would consider the basics. Companies offer their own incentives, such as paying with crypto or having servers dedicated to streaming and torrent downloads. I would not consider the use of a solely free VPN service as appropriate if you are concerned about your privacy and the security of your data.
